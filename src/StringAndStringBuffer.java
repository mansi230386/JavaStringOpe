// The String class is immutable.	The StringBuffer class is mutable.
// String is slow and consumes more memory when we concatenate too many strings because every time it creates new instance.	
// StringBuffer is fast and consumes less memory when we concatenate t strings.
//String class is slower and StringBuffer class is faster

/*
 * When to use which one : If a string is going to remain constant throughout
 * the program, then use the String class object because a String object is
 * immutable. If a string can change (for example: lots of logic and operations
 * in the construction of the string) and will only be accessed from a single
 * thread, using a StringBuilder is good enough. If a string can change and will
 * be accessed from multiple threads, use a StringBuffer because StringBuffer is
 * synchronous, so you have thread-safety. If you donâ€™t want thread-safety than
 * you can also go with StringBuilder class as it is not synchronized.
